I like to read books . I read books when my mind gets bored . It helps me imagine and make illustrations of the scenes of the story in mind . My favorite authors are Ruskin Bond and M. sudhamurthy . I usually like fantasy stories and they help me make my mind free .I improved my grammar, and vocabulary and learned to construct sentences in a proper way. Earlier, I committed several errors when I spoke. But, now I learned to use appropriate words in proper contexts.When I was 7 years old, I developed a keen interest in reading. Today, I read nearly 6 story books and 2 novels and more than 50 short stories . Also I love books which deal with science facts .A person should inculcate this hobby from their childhood because later on, they lose interest as they pass adulthood . There is hardly any book in my personal library which I have not read at least thrice . My hobby has also helped me in scoring the examination. It helps me in achieving better concentration . I borrow books from the school library and also from the public time library .
